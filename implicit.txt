implicit wait
================

driver.manage.timeout.implicitlywait(time) 

EX:- driver.manage.timeout.implicitlywait(Duration.ofSeconds(5)) 

In your application speed is more then some web element take time to loading the page if any execption came then it causes synchronization.
To handle this we can use implicit and explicit method.


Explicit methods
================

--It is applicable for only particular webelements
--its applicable in multiple times


WebDriverWait w = new WebDriverWait();

WebElement element = w.until(ExpectedConditions.vissiblityOfElementLocated(By.));
element.click();

FluentWait Method

==================
this is also similar to WebDriverWait with more flexibilty in polling time ignoring exceptions

forexample:- In our application the web element contains maximum waiting time is 30seconds but we have to declare polling time=5sec,
for every 5 seconds page reloading weather this webelement will be there or not until tim is reached up to 30 sec

30/5=6 times page is relading

syntax:
-------
	// this is Fluent wait declaration part

		Wait<WebDriver> mywait = new FluentWait<WebDriver>(driver)
				.withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
				.pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
				.ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);
